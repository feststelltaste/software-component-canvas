## Background

I've developed that canvas to get a quick overlook of a broader software system landscape. It helped me to create kind of an inventory of almost all the software systems within a company.

## Current state

This is a slightly polished version of the original. It's not documented in detail yet, but even so, I think the canvas will have more value to you this way than if it's just laying around on my hard drive.
