## Background

I've created the Software Component Canvas to get a quick overlook of a broader software system landscape. It helped me to create kind of an inventory of almost all the software systems within a company.

## Current state

This is a slightly polished version of the original. It's not documented in detail yet, but even so, I think the canvas will have more value to you this way than if it's just laying around on my hard drive.

## How does it work?

1. Fill out all the canvas areas while interviewing people who know something about the system or its creation. Alternative: research existing documents and artifacts
2. Connect all the systems based on the information of the individual systems (e.g., by using the context diagram or collaboration information).
3. Get a kind of inventory, including relationships between the systems.
4. Be happy because now you know what systems there are!
